= Creating a MicroProfile application

Learn how to build a simple application using MicroProfile technologies.

== What you'll Learn

You will learn how to use MicroProfile to build a simple inventory management application. This
application will act as an `inventory` service, storing the information about various JVMs running on
different hosts. The `inventory` service will have an entry for a particular host
if that host exposes its JVM's system properties via another RESTful web service, which you can refer to
as the `system` service. The `inventory` service will communicate with the `system` service whenever
it does not contain an entry for a particular host to retrieve the host's JVM information. Once
an entry for a host is made, that host no longer needs to expose its JVM's system properties as they
would be recorded in the `inventory` service and can be accessed directly from it. At that point, the
host can stop its `system` service.

The `system` service that you will use is the same RESTful web service that you built in
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service].
Feel free to use your own, but a complete implementation has been provided for you under `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest`.

The following diagram shows the overall layout of the inventory application:

.The `inventory` service will talk to `system` services running on various hosts to retrieve JVM system properties for those hosts. These properties are then stored in the `inventory` service which will be running on your local machine (aka localhost).

== What is MicroProfile?

MicroProfile is an initiative to optimize Java for the Microservices architecture. It is a very small,
but powerful, subset of Java EE specifications.

As of release 1.0, MicroProfile consists of JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P.

== Getting Started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the git repository and use the starting project
that is provided in the `start` directory. To do this, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-microprofile-intro.git
cd guide-microprofile-intro/start
```

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished inventory application. Feel
free to give it a try before you proceed with building your own.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then execute the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside Open Liberty:

```
mvn clean install liberty:start-server
```

Point your browser to http://localhost:9080/inventory. This is the staring point of the `inventory`
service and it displays the current contents of the inventory. As you might expect, these are empty since
nothing has been stored in the inventory yet. Next, point your browser to http://localhost:9080/inventory/localhost.
You will see a JSON with the system properties of your local JVM. By visiting this URL, these system
properties are automatically stored in the inventory. Go back to http://localhost:9080/inventory and
you see a new entry for `localhost`. For simplicity, only the OS name and username are shown here for
every host. You can repeat this process for your own hostname or any other local machine that is running
the `system` service.

Once you are done checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to start.


== Creating the inventory management application

First, lets break down the different components your application will be made out of, as well as which
part of MicroProfile each component will compliment.

1. You will need some kind of inventory manager that will edit the inventory contents, adding new entries,
removing entries, and so on. As far as MicroProfile goes, this component will use CDI so that it can
be used as an injectable bean.

2. You will need a means of establishing communication between the client and the inventory manager.
This can be done using a RESTful web service, which will respond to various HTTP requests. You will
build this service using JAX-RS and inject the inventory manager bean into it using CDI.

3. Finally, you will need some kind of wrapper for all of your RESTful web services (or just one such
  service in this guide). You will use JAX-RS to create this wrapper class.

While it was not mentioned yet, JSON-P will be used to process all JSON resources provided by the two
services.

=== Creating the inventory manager bean

The inventory manager bean is responsible for storing and retrieving various JVM system properties.

For this bean, use a simple Java Collection to store JSON objects. A more advanced application should
use a database to persist all the data, but in this example it's not necessary.

Create `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[tags=**;!comment;]
----

Your inventory is ultimately just a `ConcurrentMap` object where the key is a hostname and the value
is a JSON Java object full of various JVM system properties:

[source, Java]
----
private ConcurrentMap<String, JsonObject> inv = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
----

Your inventory manager bean contains three simple methods for retrieving (`get`) entries from the inventory,
adding (`add`) entries to the inventory, and listing (`list`) all entries currently stored in the inventory.

The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation on the class is a part of CDI and it indicates that this particular
bean is to be initialized once per the application scope. Intuitively, we want this bean to be created
just once and shared among all the clients.

// is "clients" the right word to use here^? or should be RESTful services? or something else?

Use JSON-P to process all of the JSON objects.

Finally, we are giving you two utility components: a `InventoryUtil` class and the `JsonMessages` enum.
Both of these can be found under `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/util`.

- The `InventoryUtil` class is responsible for communicating with the `system` service to retrieve JVM
system properties for a particular host that exposes them. Read the Javadoc provided in this class for
more information about its methods.
- The `JsonMessages` enum is used to build JSON Java objects for various error cases. Currently its
only used to build an error JSON whenever a particular host does not exist or is not running the `system` service.


=== Creating the inventory resource

Create a JAX-RS service that is served at the `hosts` endpoint. This class will enable the client to
communicate with the inventory manager via HTTP methods.

Create `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=**;!comment]
----

First and foremost, the `@Path` annotation on the class indicates that this service is served at the `hosts`
endpoint.

Similarly to the `InventoryManager` bean, the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is added to the class
to indicate that its to be initialized once per the application scope.

The `@Inject` annotation indicates a dependency injection. In this case, you are injecting your `InventoryManager` bean.
This makes all functionalities of your bean available in this JAX-RS service without the need of
actually instantiating the bean yourself:

[source, Java]
----
@Inject
InventoryManager manager;
----

The `@GET` annotation on a method is a part of JAX-RS and it indicates the type of HTTP request that
the method handles. GET requests always respond with some type of resource. In this case, both methods
respond with a JSON object and this is indicated by the `@Produces` annotation:

[source, Java]
----
@GET
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
----

An optional `@Path` annotation can also be placed on a method to indicate the endpoint at which the
HTTP request is handled. Additional curly braces can be used in the `@Path` annotation to treat the
endpoint as a parameter, which can then be added to the method signature using the `@PathParam` annotation:

[source, Java]
----
@Path("{hostname}")
public JsonObject getPropertiesForHost(@PathParam("hostname") String hostname) { ... }
----

Lets break down the methods:

1. `getPropertiesForHost` returns the JVM system properties for the specific host by calling the injected
`InventoryManager` bean.

2. `listContents` returns a JSON with the current contents of the inventory. This method also calls
the injected `InventoryManager` bean.


=== Creating the JAX-RS application

The last piece that you need is a JAX-RS application. This is a small wrapper class which groups all resources
under a common endpoint.

Create `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryApplication.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryApplication.java[tags=**;!comment]
----

The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is a part of JAX-RS and it indicates the common endpoint under which
all resources will be grouped. In this case, everything will be grouped under `inventory`. This makes
the starting point of your `inventory` service to be http://localhost:9080/inventory.

The `getPropertiesForHost` method is then served at http://localhost:9080/inventory/\{hostname}
and the `listContents` method at http://localhost:9080/inventory (since it didn't have a defined `@Path` annotation).

Your inventory application is now finished.


// =================================================================================================
// Starting the application
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the application

To start your inventory application run the Maven `liberty:start-server` goal from the command line:

```
mvn liberty:start-server
```

This will start an Open Liberty server on your machine. Your POM is already configured to start the
`inventory` and `system` services in this server instance. These can then be accessed at:

- http://localhost:9080/inventory
- http://localhost:9080/system


// =================================================================================================
// Testing
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the inventory application

While you can test your application manually, you should rely on automated tests since they will trigger
a failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API provide a simple environment
for you to write tests.

Begin by creating a test class `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testClass;!comment;!tests;!helpers]
----

The `@BeforeClass` annotation is placed on a method that will execute before any of the test cases run.
In this case, the `oneTimeSetup` method retrieves the port number for the Open Liberty server and builds
a base URL string that will be used throughout the tests.

The `@Before` and `@After` annotations are placed on methods that execute before and after every test case.
These methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks. In this case, the `setup` method
creates a JAX-RS client in order to make HTTP requests to the `inventory` service. This client must
also be registered with a JSON-P provider to process JSON resources. The `teardown` method simply
destroys this client instance.

Next, add a few test case methods to test the functionality of your inventory application. Start by
creating a method that verifies that the inventory starts off as being empty when the server first
starts up:

Create `testEmptyInventory()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testEmptyInventory]
----

Next, create a method that verifies that a host is correctly added to the inventory.

Create `testHostRegistration()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testHostRegistration]
----

Next, create a method that verifies that the JVM system properties returned by the `system` service match
the ones stored in the `inventory` service.

Create `testSystemPropertiesMatch()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testSystemPropertiesMatch]
----

Finally, create a method that verifies that an unknown host or a host that does not expose their JVM system
properties is correctly handled as an error.

Create `testUnknownHost()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testUnknownHost]
----

To force these test cases to execute in a particular order, create a test "suite" method and label
it with a `@Test` annotation so that its automatically executed when your test class runs.

Create `testSuite()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testSuite]
----

One last bit is to add the unimplemented helper methods that are used throughout the tests:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=helpers;!javadoc]
----

Complete Javadocs for these methods are available under the `finish` directory for reference:
`finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java`.


=== Running the tests

If the server is still running from the previous steps, stop it first using the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Then, verify that the tests pass using the Maven `verify` goal:

```
mvn verify
```

It may take some time before build is complete. If the tests pass, you see a similar output to the following:
